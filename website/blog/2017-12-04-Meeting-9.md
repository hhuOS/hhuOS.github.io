**Virtual Memory**

- management of physical and logical memory working

**File system**

- mount command working
- elf loader working (but API missing)

**UHCI**

- reading from USB working in qemu but not native

**I/O-Manager**

- thread creation should be avoided due to its overhead
- passing I/O-requests to drivers can be done in application thread
- the driver decides whether the calling thread needs to be blocked
- for deblocking threads we need some kind of request queue managed per device
- interrupts need to deblock waiting threads when their I/O request are finished
- association of I/O-requests and waiting threads need to be discussed
