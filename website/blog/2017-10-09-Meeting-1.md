Brainstorming about features for hhuOS

**General**

-   Is it complex to port an existing C-library (newlib)?
-   Which file-format, linker and system-call interfsce shall we provide?
-   Different memory management for processes and kernel/driver?
-   Do we need a process-management? 

   -   divided adress spaces for kernel- and userland?
   -   no use of rings in x86?

-   Exchange of files via null modem?

   -   Driver & client for HHUos
   -   Client for Linux

**BIOS/UEFI**

-   UEFI: there should be further investigation

   -   maybe some device drivers from UEFI can be used
   -   the system would run on modern hardware only 

-   preferred: BIOS as basis to be backward compatible to older laptops


**Filesystem**

-   Low-level ATA-Driver necessary (with DMA, if possible)
-   on top of this some partition management
-   support for filesystems: FAT16/32 (?)

**Network**

-   Problem: we need low-level drivers for different chips
-   maybe some chips from the same manufacturer are comaptible to each other?
-   There open-source TCP/IP stacks are available (for embedded devices)
    so this part should be no problem
-   we need a file systems for network-applications

**GUI**

-   interesting, but not mainly focussed
