**I/O-Manager**

- application thread will block on I/O and register I/O even object 
  (containing state for I/O, e.g. buffer ptr, as well as a pointer to the thread object)
- interrupts will deblock application thread
- later we might split interrupt-handling like in Linux and Windows

   * important hardware-related actions are done within interrupt
   * anything less-important will be executed delayed by using an event object in an event queue processed by a system thread (one thread for all processes)

- GUI-related event processing will be decoupled from this low-level event processing

   * there will be one central system thread for processing mouse & keyboard events 
   * dispatching these events by callbacks to callbacks of processes owning the shell or window with focus

**VFS**

- rout level directory is now a list of mount points
- /dev will be organized hierarchical including objects & attributes like /sys

**USB**

- reading from block devices is working

**NIC**

- Abdelrahman Abdelgalil plans to develop an E1000 NIC driver 

**Paging**

- bugfixes in BIOS call related to GDT
