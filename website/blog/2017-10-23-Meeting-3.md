**Project state**

-   Merging of existing features in git is near-complete

**Decisions**

-   Documentation 

   -   Important facts shall be documented in text (compact)
   -   use of Markdown-Files

-   ATA Taskfile-based implementation for block-devices is favored
-   Further support for serial-port is is stopped for now, because most modern
    PCs and laptops do not have COM-Ports.

**Process- and memory management**

-   Global memory-map for constant addresses in one header-file
-   Step 1: map kernel to high memory-addresses

   -   at 3 GB in virtual memory
   -   use of paging is required
   -   expand the memory management (virtual and physical management, object-oriented)
   -   for now, no seperation between kernel- ans userspace
   -   all current features should run at the end of this step

-   Step 2: seperated address spaces between processes 

   -   one thread per process, but process- and thread-controll-block
   -   no seperation between kernel- and userspace
   -   Process-creation via fork (UNIX-like)

-   Stufe 3: Seperation of kernel- and userspace 

   -   ein Thread pro Prozess, aber Trennung Prozess- und Threadkontrollblock
   -   one thread per process, but seperation between process- and thread-controll-block

**Filesystem**

-   AHCI-Implememtation is working
-   FAT32 is ported and works in HHUos2 (via extern library -> License!)
-   VFS is abstracted from the underlying hardware and in progress


**Network**

-   UDP-Implementation via Option-ROM will be investigated further
-   Fallback: NIC-Driver 
-   On top: Port or Implementation of the TCP/IP-Protokoll
