title: Release 0.2
---

More than three months have passed, since we released hhuOS v0.1, but now we have finally decided to release the second version of hhuOS.  
A lot of work has gone into fixing bugs. The system is now much more stable than it was, when we released version 0.1.  
There is also support for many new devices, such as *Serial ports*, *Parallel ports*, the *ISA DMA bus* and *Floppy controllers*.  
The system now also supports loading files from an *Initial ramdisk*, which might be handy for further releases of hhuOS.

There have been many more changes. A full list of all commits between v0.1 and v0.2 can be found [here](https://github.com/hhuOS/hhuOS/compare/v0.1...v0.2).

You can get the release here: [hhuOS v0.2](https://github.com/hhuOS/hhuOS/releases/tag/v0.2).  
The latest version of hhuOS and instructions on how to build it can always be found on our [GitHub-Repository](https://github.com/hhuOS/hhuOS).
