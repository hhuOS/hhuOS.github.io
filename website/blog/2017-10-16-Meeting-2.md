title: Meeting 2
---

**ToDos until next week**

1.  Every group takes some notices about their ideas/plans for 
    the implementation.
2.  Merge some already implemented features from the different team members 
    into hhuOS.


**Assignment of the planned features**

-   Process and memory management: Burak Akguel und Christian Gesse
-   Virtual File System (VFS) und Datei-Exe-Format (ELF): Fabian Ruhland
-   ATA Blockdevice Driver: Filip Krakowski
-   Netzwork (Serial-Port, RemoteFS, Network-ROM): Jochen Peters


**Process- and memory management**

-   Seperated address spaces
-   Memory management for each process via page tables
-   No page-swapping to disk
-   Ring-protection is planned., if possible
-   Seperate memory management for kernel- and userspace


**Filesystem**

-   ATA-driver via PCI - first PIO, then UDMA
-   Support for partition tables?
-   Possible file systems: FAT16, EXT2
-   On top of the specific filesystem a virtual filesystem, like the VFS of the Linux-Kernel, is planned


**Network**

-   A simple connection via null-modem would be useful to begin with

   -   for file-exchange -> RemoteFS
   -   for debugging -> Debug-terminal

-   maybe some simple features of the Network-ROM (BIOS) can be used


**Integration of exixisting features for HHUos from different team-members**

from Burak Akguel, Christian Gesse

-   Spinlocks
-   improved synchronization in scheduler (later) 
-   Driver for mouse (later)

from Fabian Ruhland

-   C-Library
-   Graphics-Mode
-   Real Time Clock

from Filip Krakowski

-   Support for shortcuts (keyboard)
-   Memory Management: Merging feature
-   Double Buffering
-   Graphical Menu

**Further decisions**

-   After merging of existing features every group uses their own branch in git

   -   Addition: try to merge when some part of the implementation is stable

-   Later: project goes Open Source, Licensing has to be discussed
-   All comments in source code should be in English and in Javadoc-Style
