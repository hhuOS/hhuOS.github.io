title: Release 0.2.1
---

It has been exactly three months since the last release, and now we are proud to present hhuOS v0.2.1.  
This is mostly a bugfix release, but it also offers some new features, such as:

* Initial support for ISA-based SoundBlaster cards.
* New shell commands: bmpview, wavplay and beep
* An overhauled mouse demo, which is now much more graphically appealing

Those are not all of the changes. A full list of all commits between v0.2 and v0.2.1 can be found [here](https://github.com/hhuOS/hhuOS/compare/v0.2...v0.2.1)
