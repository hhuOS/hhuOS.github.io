Today we released hhuOS v0.2.2.  
This release contains some bugfixes and many changes under the hood, such as:

* An improved scheduler, that now supports priorities
* A more efficent way of handling interrupts and support for interrupted interrupts
* Initial support for booting on EFI-based systems - See the README for more details on running hhuOS on BIOS- and EFI-based systems
