**Process- and memory managemend**

-   Kernel is mapped at 3GB
-   first step with 4MB pages is realized
-   BIOS-calls are causing problems: the switch to Realmode requires disabled paging, but the next instruction-address in EIP is not valid after disabling
-   possible solution: crate an extra address-sapce via 4mb-paging with the Kernel mapped at 0GB and 3GB - turning off paging should be no problem then
-   this solution might sound bad considering performance, but the switch to Realmode has negative impact on performance in general


**Filesystem**

-   there are problems with control of the HDD on real hardware
-   VFS is basically working -> mount-Logic is the next step


**Network**

-   Network: Code of the ROM has to be located after booting


**Miscellaneous**

-   Assembler-Code is divided into several files and restructured

   -   more changes expected for paging-implementation

-   Fallback from VGA to CGA-Mode does not work on real hardware
-   Sempahore should be improved with use of a Spinlock
-   existing Spinlock should be used for this
