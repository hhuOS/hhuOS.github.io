Welcome to hhuOS, a **small operating system** written in C++ and Assembler for
x86-architectures. The main purpose of this project is to show how different 
aspects of operating systems theory can be implemented and linked together. 
The system is *not* aimed to be a full-featured operating system for daily use.
